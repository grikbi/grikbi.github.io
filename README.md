# Grikbi
----
_LOGO TBD_

_Grikbi_ means smart in [Dimasa language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimasa_language) 
of India. We named this opensource project as Grikbi because we are building
a smart system for developers to get various types of insights on their
applications.

### Dependency Insights

Dependencies are the building blocks of modern applications and the Grikbi
engine generates following data and AI driven insights on applications based 
on their runtime dependencies:

a. Reported security vulnerabilities and possible alternate version without
vulnerability.
b. Application license suggestion.
c. Latest versions of dependencies.
d. AI based possible additional runtime dependencies.

The Grikbi engine supports dependency insights for Node NPM, Java Maven and
Python PyPi development ecosystems.


### Security Vulnerability Prediction
